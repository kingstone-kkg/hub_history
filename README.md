# HubL Visual Studio Code Language Extension
(will put this up in VSCode Store in early Jan)

[HubL](https://designers.hubspot.com/docs/hubl/intro-to-hubl) is the underlying syntax used in the [HubSpot content management system](https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/content-management-system). HubL can be used to dynamically render content, as well as generate easy to edit modules within the content editors marketers work in so they do not ever need to touch the underlying HTML of a template. This allows for many pages to use a single template, making managing content and websites significantly easier and quicker.

This is a HubL language extension for the [Visual Studio Code IDE](https://code.visualstudio.com/), allowing for :rocket: fast local HubSpot CMS Platform development in `.html` files. For comprehensive HubL documentation, see the [HubL docs](https://designers.hubspot.com/docs/hubl/intro-to-hubl).

All HubL snippets are auto-generated by the `hubl_snippets_gen.py` script from `@JinjavaDoc` annotations to ensure the snippets are always up to date, and easy to maintain :potable_water:

_For nice HubL syntax highlighting, install the [Jinja scopes extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wholroyd.jinja) which lays on top of `.html` files._

## Features
### __HubL Snippets__  
All HubL supported tags, filters and functions have auto-complete snippts. Filters are accessed with `|` and fucntions/tags are acccessed with `~`. Entering `~` or `|` will produce all HubL snippets and further typing will narrow the results. All snippets include descriptions and parameter details. You up/down arrow to navigate the IntelliSense and hit enter to execute a snippet. Snippet completed HubL statements will auto-highlight avaiable parameters, which can be tabbed through.     

![Parameters](https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/2359872/IMPORTANT/DONOTDELETE/hubl-language-extension/details.png)
__HubL Tags__ produce entire HubL tag statements with available parameters. Ex `~he` > Enter produces:
```
{% header "my_header" 
   header_tag="header_tag",
   value="value" 
%}
```
__HubL Filters__ produce entire HubL filter statements with available parameters. Ex `~se` > Enter produces:
```
|selectattr(attr, exp_test)
```
__HubL Functions__ produce entire HubL function statements with available parameters, without wrapping curly braces. The intenion of this is so you can  use HubL functions within other HubL statements easily (like setting variables, for loops, etc.) Ex `~hub` > Enter produces:
```
hubdb_table_rows(table_id,query)
```

_NOTE_: HubL tags, functions and filters are all pulled from the `cos-rendering/v1/hubldoc` api, so do not update the `snippets/hubl_filters.json`, `snippets/hubl_tags.json` or `snippets/hubl_.json` manually. Run `hubl_snippets_gen.py` to re-generate these JSON files when HubL changes occur. `snippets/hubl_extras.json` is for any extra/helpful snippets used in HubL - this file is maintained manually.

_NOTE_: If you are having trouble getting IntelliSense suggestions when in snippet placeholders you may need to add the following to your [User Settings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings) `"editor.suggest.snippetsPreventQuickSuggestions": false`. If parameter suggestions are not showing up, set `"editor.parameterHints": true`.

### __HubL Langage Configuration__  
`langconfig/language-configuration.json` contains some nice to haves when it comes to writing HubL. This supports auto completes of all HubL statement types and supports HubL statement swrapping (highlight text and  type HubL statement to wrap). Supports `{%%}`,`{##}`,`{{}}`
